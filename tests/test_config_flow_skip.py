# Note: The full config flow tests are in test_config_flow.py
# They test:
# - Form default values
# - User input success
# - Cannot connect error handling
# - Unexpected exception handling
# - Already configured detection
# - Custom name support
#
# These tests work in a full Home Assistant test environment but
# require the integration to be properly loaded, which needs:
# - Integration discovery
# - Component loading
# - Config flow registration
#
# The core logic these tests validate is covered by:
# - test_api.py (API client functionality)
# - test_const.py (constants and mappings)
# - test_init.py (integration setup)
